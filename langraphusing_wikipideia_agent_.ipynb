              " AIMessage(content=[{'type': 'text', 'text': '**Agentic AI** refers to artificial intelligence systems that can reason, plan, and take autonomous actions to achieve a specific goal.\\n\\nWhile traditional AI (like a standard chatbot) is **reactive**—meaning it waits for a prompt and provides a response—Agentic AI is **proactive**. It doesn\\'t just talk about a task; it uses tools and makes decisions to complete the task from start to finish.\\n\\nHere is a breakdown of what makes AI \"agentic,\" how it works, and why it matters.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 1. The Core Difference: Chatbot vs. Agent\\n*   **Non-Agentic AI (The Thinker):** You ask, \"What is the weather in Tokyo?\" The AI searches its training data or a single tool and tells you. It stops there.\\n*   **Agentic AI (The Doer):** You say, \"I want to go to Tokyo next month. Find me a flight under $1,000, book a hotel near Shibuya, and add the itinerary to my calendar.\" The AI breaks this down into steps, uses various websites/APIs, handles the booking, and updates your calendar without you guiding every click.\\n\\n### 2. Key Characteristics of Agentic AI\\nTo be considered \"agentic,\" a system generally possesses four traits:\\n*   **Autonomy:** It can operate for extended periods without constant human intervention.\\n*   **Reasoning & Planning:** It can break a complex goal (e.g., \"Research this company\") into smaller sub-tasks (e.g., \"Find their SEC filings,\" \"Look up their CEO,\" \"Summarize their last three product launches\").\\n*   **Tool Use:** It can interact with the outside world. This includes using web browsers, running code, accessing databases, or using third-party apps like Slack or Excel.\\n*   **Self-Correction:** If an agent tries to run a piece of code and gets an error, it doesn\\'t just stop. It analyzes the error, rewrites the code, and tries again.\\n\\n### 3. How the \"Agentic Loop\" Works\\nAgentic AI typically operates in a loop often referred to as **Perception → Planning → Action → Observation**:\\n1.  **Perception:** The agent receives a goal and assesses the environment.\\n2.  **Planning:** It creates a roadmap of steps to reach the goal.\\n3.  **Action:** It executes a step (e.g., \"Search Google for X\").\\n4.  **Observation:** It looks at the result of that action. Did it work? What did it learn?\\n5.  **Iteration:** Based on the observation, it updates its plan and goes back to step 3 until the goal is met.\\n\\n### 4. Real-World Examples\\n*   **Software Engineering:** Agents like *Devin* or *OpenDevin* can be given a bug report. They will explore the codebase, find the bug, write a fix, run tests to ensure it works, and submit a pull request.\\n*   **Customer Support:** Instead of just answering \"How do I return this?\", an agentic system can verify your identity, look up your order, initiate the return label, and email it to you.\\n*   **Market Research:** An agent can spend hours scouring the web, synthesizing data from 50 different sources, and producing a formatted report while the human user does other work.\\n\\n### 5. Why is this the \"Next Frontier\"?\\nThe tech industry is shifting from **Generative AI** (creating content) to **Agentic AI** (executing workflows). \\n*   **Efficiency:** It moves AI from being a \"writing assistant\" to a \"digital employee.\"\\n*   **Complexity:** It allows AI to handle multi-step projects that previously required human project management.\\n\\n### 6.

            "[{'type': 'text', 'text': '**Agentic AI** refers to artificial intelligence systems that can reason, plan, and take autonomous actions to achieve a specific goal.\\n\\nWhile traditional AI (like a standard chatbot) is **reactive**—meaning it waits for a prompt and provides a response—Agentic AI is **proactive**. It doesn\\'t just talk about a task; it uses tools and makes decisions to complete the task from start to finish.\\n\\nHere is a breakdown of what makes AI \"agentic,\" how it works, and why it matters.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 1. The Core Difference: Chatbot vs. Agent\\n*   **Non-Agentic AI (The Thinker):** You ask, \"What is the weather in Tokyo?\" The AI searches its training data or a single tool and tells you. It stops there.\\n*   **Agentic AI (The Doer):** You say, \"I want to go to Tokyo next month. Find me a flight under $1,000, book a hotel near Shibuya, and add the itinerary to my calendar.\" The AI breaks this down into steps, uses various websites/APIs, handles the booking, and updates your calendar without you guiding every click.\\n\\n### 2. Key Characteristics of Agentic AI\\nTo be considered \"agentic,\" a system generally possesses four traits:\\n*   **Autonomy:** It can operate for extended periods without constant human intervention.\\n*   **Reasoning & Planning:** It can break a complex goal (e.g., \"Research this company\") into smaller sub-tasks (e.g., \"Find their SEC filings,\" \"Look up their CEO,\" \"Summarize their last three product launches\").\\n*   **Tool Use:** It can interact with the outside world. This includes using web browsers, running code, accessing databases, or using third-party apps like Slack or Excel.\\n*   **Self-Correction:** If an agent tries to run a piece of code and gets an error, it doesn\\'t just stop. It analyzes the error, rewrites the code, and tries again.\\n\\n### 3. How the \"Agentic Loop\" Works\\nAgentic AI typically operates in a loop often referred to as **Perception → Planning → Action → Observation**:\\n1.  **Perception:** The agent receives a goal and assesses the environment.\\n2.  **Planning:** It creates a roadmap of steps to reach the goal.\\n3.  **Action:** It executes a step (e.g., \"Search Google for X\").\\n4.  **Observation:** It looks at the result of that action. Did it work? What did it learn?\\n5.  **Iteration:** Based on the observation, it updates its plan and goes back to step 3 until the goal is met.\\n\\n### 4. Real-World Examples\\n*   **Software Engineering:** Agents like *Devin* or *OpenDevin* can be given a bug report. They will explore the codebase, find the bug, write a fix, run tests to ensure it works, and submit a pull request.\\n*   **Customer Support:** Instead of just answering \"How do I return this?\", an agentic system can verify your identity, look up your order, initiate the return label, and email it to you.\\n*   **Market Research:** An agent can spend hours scouring the web, synthesizing data from 50 different sources, and producing a formatted report while the human user does other work.\\n\\n### 5. Why is this the \"Next Frontier\"?\\nThe tech industry is shifting from **Generative AI** (creating content) to **Agentic AI** (executing workflows). \\n*   **Efficiency:** It moves AI from being a \"writing assistant\" to a \"digital employee.\"\\n*   **Complexity:** It allows AI to handle multi-step projects that previously required human project management.\\n\\n### 6.
